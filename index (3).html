      <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Business Economics student at the University of California, Riverside, where I am building a strong foundation in analytical thinking, finance, and strategic decision-making. My academic journey reflects both curiosity and ambition—I am deeply interested in understanding how systems work, how organizations grow, and how thoughtful leadership can create meaningful impact. I approach my education with the mindset that learning is not just about mastering theory, but about applying it in real-world settings.<br><br>
          Alongside my studies, I serve as the Lead Coach for the UC Riverside Women’s Soccer Club. In this role, I manage team operations and logistics, ensuring that practices and games run smoothly and efficiently. From coordinating schedules to organizing equipment and maintaining clear communication between players and staff, I focus on creating an environment where athletes can perform at their best. Leadership, to me, means more than directing others—it means setting the tone, building trust, and fostering accountability. Coaching has strengthened my ability to lead diverse groups, solve problems under pressure, and remain adaptable in fast-paced situations.

Previously, I worked at 3M Fall Protection in a blocks assembly role, where precision and efficiency were essential. I assembled retractable lifelines for safety harnesses, following detailed work instructions that required careful attention to quality control. Within my first month, my speed, accuracy, and quick learning earned me placement on a more rigorous assembly team with higher production quotas. This experience reinforced my commitment to discipline, consistency, and high standards. It also taught me the importance of operational excellence—how small details directly impact safety, performance, and overall outcomes.

My experience at Patelco Credit Union as an MCC Specialist allowed me to strengthen my communication and analytical skills in a financial services environment. I analyzed member messages to understand their needs, facilitated balance transfers, and assisted with account management. More importantly, I focused on enhancing financial literacy by guiding members toward solutions that aligned with their goals. This role deepened my understanding of customer engagement and the value of clear, empathetic communication in professional settings.<br><br>
          Beyond formal roles, I have actively pursued leadership and professional development opportunities. As a participant in Genesys Works Bay Area, I strengthened my project management skills and gained hands-on experience manipulating data in Excel, including pivot tables and data visualization. My time as Senior Class President in Student Senate further developed my event planning and organizational abilities, as I coordinated fundraisers, assemblies, and large-scale events while working with multiple stakeholders.

Across all of these experiences, a common thread defines my approach: I am driven, adaptable, and committed to growth. I value teamwork, data-informed decision-making, and leadership that empowers others. Whether in athletics, operations, finance, or academics, I strive to contribute with integrity, precision, and purpose while continuously pushing myself to improve.
